## C9.io Readme

This  showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
